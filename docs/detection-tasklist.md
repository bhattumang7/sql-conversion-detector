# SilentScan detection checklist

Open work and the decisions that close it. The research behind it — anti-pattern
space, incumbent survey, measured engine facts, calibrated thresholds, killed
candidates — is in `detection-reference.md`. Every shipped rule is in
`rules.html`.

A shipped item's entry is deleted, not annotated. Only two things outlive an
item: a fact that can't be re-derived from the code, and a decision that
would otherwise be re-proposed — both move to `detection-reference.md`'s
Settled section.

Competitor tools are referred to generically; real identities are in
`vendor/tool-references.md` (gitignored).

## Out of scope

Production-only signals — the one real exclusion under CLAUDE.md's scope rule.
Parameter sniffing depends on the runtime data distribution and on which value
first compiled the plan; runtime-only signals (spills, memory grants, execution
frequency, stale statistics, plan-cache duplication, row-estimate mismatch)
don't exist until a query runs. The static risk factors for sniffing ship as
their own findings.

## For every new stream

Thresholds are calibrated against the real measured distribution, never copied
from convention. Record the calibration in `detection-reference.md`
Appendix 10.

Before writing (or re-auditing) a rule whose rationale depends on a session
setting, a keyword list, a data-type set, or a fixed option enum: find the
engine's own closed enumeration for it - a ScriptDom enum, a live catalog/DMV
(`sys.dm_os_performance_counters`, `sys.configurations`,
`sys.database_scoped_configurations`), or an internal engine table via
`vendor/sql2025` (target the function that *consumes* a fixed-size table,
not a decompiled enum's member names - those rarely survive compilation) -
and diff every member against the rule's actual coverage. Free-text sources
(`sys.messages`) don't work for this: there's no reliable way to rank them by
relevance, so don't try. Oracle-verify every surviving candidate before
trusting it - a structurally-missing case is not yet a confirmed gap.
